If you need to delete an image from the database, then just change the code

src/components/images/components/image/image.jsx
```JS

  if (DelPressed === true) {
    if (click === true) {
      // if you want to delete a document
      // deleteDoc(clickRef, {
      //   show: false,
      //   click: false,
      // })
      updateDoc(clickRef, {
        show: false,
        click: false,
      })
        .then(() => {
          console.log("deleted");
        })
        .catch((e) => {
          console.log(e);
        });
    }
  }
```
